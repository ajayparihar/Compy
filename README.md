## Customization Guide

### CompyRunner Settings
The `CompyRunner.bat` file can be customized to match your setup:

1. Open `CompyRunner.bat` in any text editor
2. Modify these variables at the top of the file:
   ```batch
   :: HTML files location (where COMPY is installed)
   set "HTML_DIRECTORY=C:\Users\username\path\to\compy"

   :: Server port number (if 8000 is already in use)
   set "PORT=8000"
   ```
3. Common customizations:
   - Change `HTML_DIRECTORY` to your COMPY installation path
   - Modify `PORT` if port 8000 is already in use
   - Save changes and run CompyRunner as usual

Note: If you change the port, remember to access COMPY using the new port number in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:9000` if you set PORT=9000)
