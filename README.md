Ah, I see! You want to add a "New" tag next to the **Password Masking** feature in the list of features to indicate it's a new addition in **V1.1**. Here's the updated **README.md** with that "New" tag added:

---

# Compy V1.1

## Overview
**Compy** is a simple and efficient web-based tool that helps you manage and quickly access your saved data. Whether itâ€™s commands, credentials, short notes, or any other important information, Compy provides an intuitive interface for easy storage and retrieval.

---

## Features
1. **Dynamic Data Loading**  
   Easily load your data from an online CSV file or a local file.

2. **Customizable Use Cases**  
   Use Compy for a variety of purposes:  
   - Saving commands and code snippets.  
   - Storing personal credentials or notes.  
   - Keeping track of tasks, reference points, and more.

3. **Interactive Search**  
   Instantly search and filter your data with live updates. Matched search terms are highlighted for quick identification.

4. **Copy to Clipboard**  
   Simply click on any item to copy it to your clipboard. A toast notification confirms the action.

5. **Automatic Updates**  
   Reload the page to reset filters and fetch updated data.

6. **Highlight Matches**  
   Matched search terms are dynamically highlighted to make it easier to find relevant data.

7. **Password Masking** **(New)**  
   **Password Masking** is a feature that hides sensitive data (like passwords, API keys, etc.) by wrapping it in a special masking keyword (e.g., `##Password##`). This ensures that sensitive information is not displayed directly in the interface.  
   
   **Customizable Masking Keyword**: The keyword used for masking data (such as `##`) is now customizable. You can change this keyword to any symbol or word (e.g., `**`) by updating the code. This flexibility allows you to adapt the tool to your security needs and preferences, making it easier to manage sensitive information.

   ```
3. Replace the URL with the link to your CSV file.

#### Option 2: Using a Local CSV File
1. Place your CSV file in the project directory.
2. Update the `fetch` call in `script.js` to reference the local file, like this:
   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('./path-to-your-file.csv');
   ```

### Update the Masking Keyword
To customize the password masking keyword (e.g., change `##` to `**`):
1. Open `script.js`.
2. Locate the `config` object:
   ```javascript
   const config = {
     passwordMaskingKeyword: '##' // Change this to '**' or any other keyword
   };
   ```
3. Update `passwordMaskingKeyword` to your preferred keyword, such as `**`.
